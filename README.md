Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is increasingly prevalent in classrooms worldwide, posing significant challenges to both students and educators.
These challenges stem from core ADHD symptoms - impulsiveness, inattention, and hyperactivity - that interfere with traditional methods of language acquisition.
Attenglish is a specialized mobile application designed to meet the unique needs of ADHD learners in elementary to high-school settings. 
By leveraging interactive modules, adaptive pacing, and evidence-based teaching strategies, the app seeks to boost engagement, bolster linguistic confidence, and provide real-time feedback to pupils, teachers and parents.
Attenglish offers not only effective language instruction, but also the tools for continuous progress monitoring, facilitating tailor-made interventions.
As part of a broader inclusive education approach, this book presents how Attenglish addresses core ADHD learning gaps,
lays out the engineering and testing processes, and positions the technology as a vital tool for teachers aiming to support ADHD pupils in mastering English.
